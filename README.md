## What is EGG LDO 250?

The **LDO 250** is the first board in the modular **EGG** design series. The **EGG** series is a conceptual compilation of many different modules.
Modules are created from independent circuit parts which have repeatedly appeared in my PCB designs.
Each of my circuits starts with the voltage source which is why **LDO 250** provides a linear voltage regulator with a low dropout voltage and a maximum current of 250 mA.
